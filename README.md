# ILib
A personal library for book lovers! This was origionally my idea for a bigger project, but I will continue to play around with this and see what I can do. The goal of ILib is to help users keep track of books they'd like to purchase, and will in the future allow users to search and add books (using an API), then browse their library for those books added!

## Installation

1. Clone repo
2. run `npm install`

## Usage

1. run `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `localhost:1234`
3. Login: username `admin@admin.com` ; password `admin`


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB.

It's a basic CRUD app right now that allows users to add a book they'd like to purchase and keep it stored as a note.

## Future Optimization

I look to improve this app by allowing users to search for books and add those to their library. 

## Lessons Learned:

I look to learn more about fetching api's when building a CRUD application. This will be an ongoing side-project!
